# Kubernetes + Exec Mixin Example

This is a sample Porter bundle that makes use of both the Kubernetes and Exec mixins. The Kubernetes mixin is used to apply Kubernetes manifests to an existing Kubernetes cluster, creating an NGINX deployment and a service. The Kubernetes mixin is also used to produce an output with the value of the service's ClusterIP.  After the kubernetes mixin finishes, the `exec` mixin is ued to echo the cluster IP of the service that was created. 

To use this bundle, you will need an existing Kubernetes cluster and a kubeconfig file for use as a credential.

```
porter build
porter credentials generate
porter install -c kubernetes
```

ðŸš¨ GKE requires additional credentials and parameters in order to [connect to a cluster][gke-connect], so use the [GKE Example](/examples/gke-example) instead.
